[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools)

# Introduction
This is an R package for the bromeliad working group rainfall experiment. Our intention is to create a set of tools that facilitate all steps of the process:

* loading data into R
* validating the data
* combining data from different levels
* performing calculations
* performing analyses and
* creating figures

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools/issues) if there is a feature you would like to see, or if you discover an error or bug!

# Installation

`bwgtools` can be installed directly from Github using devtools:

```r
install.packages("devtools") # if you don't have devtools
library(devtools)
install_github("SrivastavaLab/bwgtools", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Loading data into R

`bwgtools` uses [rdrop2](https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2) to access your Dropbox account, then uses [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) to download the data and read it directly into R. When you first run `library(bwgtools)` you will see the following message:

> Welcome to the bwg R package! in order to obtain data from the BWG dropbox folder, you need to authorize R to access your dropbox. run the following commands: 
  library(rdrop2) 
  drop_acc() 
 then enter your username and password. This should only need to be done once per directory.

This will create a file called `.httr-oauth` in your directory, which will contain your login credentials for Dropbox. **Remember to add this file to your .gitignore if you are using git**. For more information, see `?rdrop2::drop_auth`.

## First steps

You can read data directly into R . For example:

```r
macae <- read_site_sheet("Macae", "leaf.waterdepths")
```

We can also do some basic checking 

```r
check_names(macae)
```

## Future plans

We want to use this package to store functions which reproduce all of the analyses of the Bromeliad Working Group.

### Licence
