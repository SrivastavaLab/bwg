[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools)

# Introduction
This is an R package for the bromeliad working group rainfall experiment. Our intention is to create a set of tools that facilitate all steps of the process:

* loading data into R
* validating the data
* combining data from different levels
* performing calculations
* performing analyses and
* creating figures

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/SrivastavaLab/bwgtools/issues) if there is a feature you would like to see, or if you discover an error or bug!

# Installation

`bwgtools` can be installed directly from Github using devtools:

```r
install.packages("devtools") # if you don't have devtools
library(devtools)
install_github("SrivastavaLab/bwgtools", dependencies = TRUE)
```

# Loading data into R
## Accessing Dropbox

`bwgtools` uses [rdrop2](https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2) to access your Dropbox account, then uses [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) to download the data and read it directly into R. When you first run `library(bwgtools)` you will see the following message:

```
Welcome to the bwg R package! in order to obtain data from the BWG dropbox folder, you need to authorize R to access your dropbox. run the following commands: 
  library(rdrop2) 
  drop_acc() 
 then enter your username and password. This should only need to be done once per directory.
```

This will create a file called `.httr-oauth` in your directory, which will contain your login credentials for Dropbox. **Remember to add this file to your .gitignore if you are using git**. For more information, see `?rdrop2::drop_auth`.

## Obtaining data

Once you have authenticated with Dropbox, you can read data directly into R . For example, the function `read_sheet_site` will get a single tab from a single excel file (ie, a single site):

```r
macae <- read_site_sheet("Macae", "leaf.waterdepths")
```

The first argument to this function can either be the name of a site (`"Macae"`, in the example above), **or** a path to the location of the file on your hard drive. In this README we are going to use the latter approach. This has two advantages: slightly faster (nothing needs to download) and it will work non-interactively (for example when using knitr).

the major _disadvantage_ is that your local version of the data may be behind the official version on the Dropbox website. To be safe, use the online version whenever you can.

```{r results='asis'}
library(bwgtools)
macae <- read_site_sheet(offline("Macae"), "leaf.waterdepths")
knitr::kable(head(macae))
```

This approach works for loading a single tab; we can also load and combine the same tab across all sites, with a single function:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
c("Argentina", "French_Guiana", "Colombia",
  "Macae", "PuertoRico","CostaRica") %>%
  sapply(offline) %>%
  combine_tab("site.info") %>% 
  head %>% 
  kable
```

We can also do some basic checking 

```r
check_names(macae)
```

## Future plans

We want to use this package to store functions which reproduce all of the analyses of the Bromeliad Working Group.
